A non-exhaustive list of my work. 

## Swarthmore College Computer Society

I'm vice president of the [Swarthmore College Computer Society](https://www.sccs.swarthmore.edu/) (SCCS), a 30-year-old student-run organization that provides a variety of services for the Swarthmore College community. SCCS provides a student directory, classifieds, a course planner, and more, as well as a media lounge and gaming pit for student use. As Vice President, I have a key role in day-to-day club operations including recruitment, management, and communications, in addition to low-level maintenance and system administration of club infrastructure.

## Columns for the Swarthmore *Phoenix*

Since fall 2020, I've been writing a mostly-biweekly column on technology concepts in Swarthmore College's student newspaper, the [*Phoenix*](https://www.swarthmorephoenix.com/). Articles from that column are mirrored on this website.

## Streem

Over the summer of 2020, I worked fully remotely at [Streem](https://www.streem.com/) as a software engineer intern. I researched dependencies and build processes for different libraries and software solutions under consideration and communicated my findings with various pieces of documentation and presentations. I also wrote various small applications, utilities, and proofs-of-concept.

## FRC Team 1540

I spent four years on [FIRST Robotics Competition](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc) Team 1540, the [Flaming Chickens](https://team1540.org). In-season, I spent 35+ hours a week designing, building, programming, and testing 150-pound competitive robots. 

### Robot Code

I wrote significant portions of the onboard Java control code for the team's [2018](https://www.team1540.org/2018), [2019](https://www.team1540.org/2019), and [2020](https://www.team1540.org/2020) robots. Each robot codebase consisted of several thousand lines of code developed in a team of three to five students with little to no outside assistance. Especially as co-lead of the software department in 2020, I coordinated with many different stakeholders to balance software, mechanical, and electrical needs and ensure a highly effective robot. During my tenure as a member of software and design leadership, Team 1540 won several awards for software capability and robot quality. Robot code for the [2018](https://github.com/flamingchickens1540/pandora-titan-2018), [2019](https://github.com/flamingchickens1540/phineas-ferb-2019), and [2020](https://github.com/flamingchickens1540/ares-luna-2020) robots is available on GitHub.

### ROOSTER

Throughout my time on the team, I also built and maintained the [Reusable Object-Oriented Systems, Templates, and Executables for Robots](https://github.com/flamingchickens1540/ROOSTER) (ROOSTER), a common library of useful functions for team use. ROOSTER is well-documented, flexible, and easy to maintain, and made the development process much more ergonomic in stressful situations.

### CLUCK

In the summer of 2018, to replace an old time-tracking system, I developed the [Common Lab Use Clock Kit](https://github.com/flamingchickens1540/cluck-backend) (CLUCK), a flexible time clock to track hours spent in the team's robotics lab and upload them to a Google Sheets document. CLUCK is based on Kotlin and Spring Boot, with a MongoDB persistence layer. The backend and API is extremely well-documented and has had only a few hours of unplanned downtime in multiple years of service.

### Design and Fabrication

I did significant CAD work on the team's 2020 robot using Autodesk Fusion 360, and provided design and machining guidance to other members of the team. I also led an effort to revolutionize the team's CAM workflows and CNC machining practices and increased throughput by 400%. I also instructed new team members in machine tool usage and shop safety.

## Moby

I designed and built the software and systems architecture for [Moby](https://github.com/RobinsonZ/moby), an autonomous robotic brush mower. I used ROS and Python for its onboard control systems, based on a Raspberry Pi with the Navio2 hat.
