              About Me
            </h2>
            <p class="mb-4">
              My name is Zack Robinson. I write software (and occasionally
              words) to help people accomplish their goals, avoid tedium, and
              learn something new about the world we inhabit and the systems we
              use. I have a particular interest in human-computer interaction,
              embedded systems, efficient infrastructure, and cross-disciplinary
              integration.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
              I&rsquo;m studying for a BA in Computer Science, with minors in
              Engineering and English Literature, at
              <a href="https://swarthmore.edu">Swarthmore College</a>. I&rsquo;m
              also the current president of the
              <a href="https://sccs.swarthmore.edu"
                >Swarthmore College Computer Society</a
              >, a 32-year-old chartered student organization with about 40
              members. I&rsquo;m working part-time as a software engineer intern
              at <a href="https://www.arcesium.com/">Arcesium</a>.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
              I tend not to focus on specific languages, and can quickly learn
              new technologies and frameworks as needed. With that said, though,
              I&rsquo;ve done non-trivial work in Python, Typescript,
              HTML/CSS/JS, Java, Kotlin, and OCaml, plus some exposure to Rust,
              C/C++, and Verilog. I&rsquo;m familiar with deploying and running
              code in a variety of environments: from embedded systems, to
              on-premises physical servers, to managed Kubernetes clusters, to
              purely serverless cloud-based architectures.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
              I grew up in the city of Portland, Oregon. I used to be a student
              on FIRST&reg; Robotics Competition
              <a href="https://team1540.org">Team&nbsp;1540</a>, and I&rsquo;m
              still involved in the program through volunteering as a Control
              System Advisor and contributions to competition-specific
              libraries.

                2023 as a Software Engineer Intern at Arcesium. During my
                internship, I wrote a new web application for the Corporate
                Technology team that let over 1,000 developers self-manage their
                virtual workstations and decreased workstation-related developer
                queries by around 50%. I also wrote a cost analysis tool to
                break down over $1 million in annual AWS spending into an
                easy-to-understand report. I'm currently working part-time to
                develop a new component for filtering and controlling mail
                egress from Arcesium's Kubernetes cluster. &nbsp;FA-COMPUTER

                2022 as a System Administrator Intern at Polaris, one of the
                world&rsquo;s leading powersports manufacturers. Using Ansible
                Playbooks and some PowerShell, I helped migrate several hundred
                legacy Windows virtual machines from an on-premises system to a
                cloud-based hosting provider. I also helped my intern team win
                the companywide &ldquo;Innovation Challenge&rdquo; by developing
                and presenting two new features for Polaris&rsquo;s connected
                vehicle offerings.

                for a new video backend system, and worked on a new system for
                logging and metrics ingestion from WebRTC streams using Amazon
                Kinesis pipelines.

                initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in Spring and Summer
                2020. These were delivered directly to Portland-area hospitals
