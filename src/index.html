              About Me
            </h2>
            <p class="mb-4">
              My name is Zack Robinson. I'm a software engineer with a
              particular interest in human-computer interaction, embedded
              systems, efficient infrastructure, and cross-disciplinary
              integration. Currently, I'm working at
              <a href="https://www.spacex.com/">SpaceX</a> to provide
              <a href="https://www.starlink.com/">
                Internet from space for humans on earth</a
              >.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
              I tend not to focus on specific languages, and can quickly learn
              new technologies and frameworks as needed. With that said,
              I&rsquo;ve done non-trivial work in Python, Typescript, C#,
              HTML/CSS/JS, Java, Kotlin, and OCaml, plus some exposure to Rust,
              C/C++, and Verilog. I&rsquo;m familiar with deploying and running
              code in a variety of environments: embedded systems, mobile apps,
              on-prem servers, massive cloud-based Kubernetes clusters, and
              purely serverless architectures. In general, I enjoy any
              opportunity to drop into a new problem space and leave it better
              than I found it.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
              I completed a BA in Computer Science (with minors in Engineering
              and English Literature) at
              <a href="https://swarthmore.edu">Swarthmore College</a>. During my
              time there, I was president of the
              <a href="https://sccs.swarthmore.edu"
                >Swarthmore College Computer Society</a
              >, a 33-year-old chartered student organization with about 65
              members. I grew up in Portland, Oregon, and now live in Seattle.

                software engineer on the Starlink Consumer Platform team at
                SpaceX. We build the apps, websites, and customer support tools
                to deliver the world's most advanced satellite Internet service

                <a href="https://www.arcesium.com/">Arcesium</a>: I worked as a
                software engineer at Arcesium in New York City. In my role on
                the Infrastructure team, I helped manage several thousand Linux
                servers and provide 1,000+ engineers with the compute,
                networking, access control, CI/CD, observability, and cost
                accounting that they needed to deliver Arcesium's advanced data,
                operations, and analytics software. I interned on the Corporate
                Technology team prior to my full-time work.

                Together with <a href="https://thomasmak.in">Thomas Makin</a>, I
                spent a semester trying to play video files off of an SD card
                using an FPGA. This was a lot more difficult than we expected,
                and we didn't end up anywhere close to getting it working. But
                we learned a lot about hardware development along the way, and
                also wrote a
                <a href="/blog/posts/framebuffer/">full report</a>
                to help anyone who tries to do the same thing in the future.

                Human-Computer Interaction at the University of Pennsylvania
                (which I took through Swarthmore's cross-registration program).
                My group conducted user interviews, created low- and
                high-fidelity prototypes, and finally put everything together
                into a functional desktop app which reimagines file management
                with an intuitive drag-and-drop interface. You can download it

                PowerShell, I helped migrate several hundred legacy Windows
                virtual machines from an on-premises system to a cloud-based
                hosting provider. I also helped my intern team win the
                companywide &ldquo;Innovation Challenge&rdquo; by developing and
                presenting two new features for Polaris&rsquo;s connected

                for a new video backend system, and worked on a new system for
