# robinsonz.github.io

This is the source code for my personal website, [robinsonz.me](https://robinsonz.me). It's built with Tailwind CSS and Vite on top of a big chunk of hand-coded HTML; no fancy template engines here (for now).

## Development

```
npm install
```

Run a live-reloading instance for development:
```
npm start 
```

Build static files for production:
```
npm run build
```
Files are written to `dist/`.
